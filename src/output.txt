### Description:
The 9/11 conspiracy theory posits that the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, were not solely carried out by the group of Al-Qaeda terrorists but rather involved additional parties, such as the U.S. government or other powerful entities. Proponents of this theory argue that the attacks were an inside job orchestrated to create a pretext for the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, to increase military spending, and to justify the erosion of civil liberties.

Some of the key claims made by proponents of the 9/11 conspiracy theory include:

- Controlled Demolition: Some suggest that the collapse of the Twin Towers and World Trade Center 7 resembled controlled demolitions rather than the result of the impact of the airplanes.
  
- Insider Trading: It is argued that there was a significant increase in put options (bets that a stock will fall) placed on American and United Airlines in the days leading up to 9/11, indicating that some had prior knowledge of the attacks.

- Lack of Intercepted Aircraft: Critics highlight the failure of the U.S. military to intercept any of the four hijacked planes on 9/11, despite standard procedures and the extensive military presence in the United States.

- Pentagon Attack: Questions have been raised about the official narrative of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon, with some suggesting that the damage caused does not align with the impact of a Boeing 757.

- Withheld Information: Some theorists claim that there have been deliberate efforts to suppress evidence and hinder investigations that might reveal the truth behind the attacks.

### Evidence:
- *Controlled Demolition*: 
  - The rapid and symmetrical collapse of the Twin Towers has been likened to controlled demolitions, with some architects and engineers arguing that the buildings fell at a speed consistent with controlled demolition.
  - Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth is a group of professionals who question the official explanation and advocate for a new investigation into the collapse of the buildings.

- *Insider Trading*:
  - A study by Allen M. Poteshman from the University of Illinois suggested significant insider trading related to the 9/11 attacks, particularly in the options market.

- *Lack of Intercepted Aircraft*:
  - Critics argue that the lack of a prompt response by the U.S. military to intercept the hijacked planes raises suspicions about the events of 9/11.
  
- *Pentagon Attack*:
  - Some researchers point out discrepancies in the damage at the Pentagon and the absence of clear footage showing the impact of Flight 77.
